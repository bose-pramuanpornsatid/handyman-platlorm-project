## Project Summary

We want to 'gamify' the process of applying to Full-Time Positions / Internships. This is accomplished through having people build their own internship 'personality' representing which jobs or technical domains they are interested in and using that to create a custom set of filters for jobs that they are interested in. We can also let people access the interface directly using the filter to determine which jobs they want.

As an extra layer on top of this concept we want to make it a social system where you can collect 'streaks' for continually applying to jobs much like duolingo and possibly have a friends system setup where you can track and update each other on progress. You can also combine this with the personality concept to come up with levels or experience points to further extend the game concept. The point is to drive motivation for applying to internships and encourage people to keep on applying
